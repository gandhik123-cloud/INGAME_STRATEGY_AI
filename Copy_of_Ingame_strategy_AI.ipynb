        "    \"Q: What is Valorant? A: Valorant is a free-to-play, 5v5 character-based tactical shooter developed by Riot Games, released in 2020. It combines precise gunplay similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with unique agent abilities, akin to Overwatch. Attackers aim to plant a bomb-like device called the Spike, while defenders try to prevent or defuse it.es.\",\n",
        "    \"Q: How do I improve my aim in Valorant? A: Practice in aim labs and warm up before matches.\",\n",
        "    \"Q: How do I play Valorant? A: To play, you need a Riot Games account. For the PC version, download the game from Riot’s website, complete the tutorial, and jump into matches. On consoles (PS5, Xbox Series X/S), sign up for a Riot account to access the game, which launched in August 2024. Matches involve selecting an agent and competing in team-based objectives.\",\n",
        "    \"Q: What are the main objectives in Valorant? A:Attackers win by planting the Spike and protecting it until it detonates (45 seconds) or eliminating all defenders. Defenders win by defusing the Spike, eliminating all attackers, or letting the 100-second round timer expire without the Spike being planted.\",\n",
        "    \"Q: How does the economy system work in Valorant? A: Players earn credits based on round outcomes: 800 credits at the start of each half, 200 per kill, 3,000 for a round win, 1,900 for a loss, 2,400 for two consecutive losses, 2,900 for three or more, and 300 for planting or defusing the Spike. Max credits are 9,000, and 5,000 are given in overtime. Coordinate with your team to buy weapons, armor, and abilities wisely, balancing full buys with eco rounds to save credits. \",\n",
        "    \"Q:Why am I lagging or experiencing high ping in-game? A:High ping or lag can result from a poor internet connection, server issues, or background applications consuming bandwidth. Ensure a stable connection, close unnecessary programs, and select a server closest to your location in the game settings. Riot aims for under 35ms ping. \",\n",
        "    \"Q:What are the roles of agents in Valorant? A:Agents are divided into four roles Duelists: Aggressive fraggers (e.g., Jett, Phoenix) who lead attacks and create space with flashes and mobility.Initiators: Support players (e.g., Sova, Breach) who scout or disrupt enemies with flashes and stuns.Controllers: Area control experts (e.g., Omen, Viper) who use smokes and crowd control to block sightlines or clear areas.Sentinels: Defensive specialists (e.g., Sage, Killjoy) who lock down sites with barriers, traps, or healing.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How should I choose an agent to main? A:Start with 4–5 agents across roles to be flexible in team compositions. Beginners may find Sentinels (Sage, Killjoy) or Initiators (Sova, Breach) easier due to their supportive roles. Experiment in unrated matches to find agents that suit your playstyle, whether aggressive (Duelists) or strategic (Controllers).\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How do agent abilities work? A:Each agent has unique abilities, including a signature ability (free each round), others requiring credits, and an ultimate that charges via kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Abilities range from smokes and flashes to healing and traps, tailored to the agent’s role, and are crucial for tactical play. \",\n",
        "    \"Q:Why isn’t my ultimate ability charging? A: Ultimates charge through kills, deaths, collecting orbs on the map, or completing objectives like planting/defusing the Spike. If it’s not charging, you may not be securing enough points. Focus on grabbing orbs, getting kills, or playing objectives. In Spike Rush, ultimates charge twice as fast. \",\n",
        "    \"Q:How do I know when to use my abilities?A:Use abilities to gain a tactical advantage: smokes to block sightlines, flashes to blind enemies, or traps to secure areas. Save abilities for key moments, like planting or retaking sites, and coordinate with teammates (e.g., flashing for a Duelist’s entry). Practice in the Range to learn ability timings and lineups. \",\n",
        "    \"Q:How many maps are in Valorant, and how do they work? A:There are 11 maps, each with unique layouts and strategic elements like teleporters (Bind), ziplines (Icebox), or multiple sites (Haven). Maps rotate every three months in competitive play, requiring players to learn all. Study callouts, common angles, and site layouts to anticipate enemy movements.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:Which maps are best for specific agents? A:Some maps favor certain agents due to their layout. For example, Jett’s mobility shines on maps with high platforms like Ascent, while Cypher’s traps excel on tight maps like Split. Experiment in custom games to learn map-specific strategies for your agent.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How do I learn map callouts quickly?A:Study map callouts via Riot’s official map pages or community guides on YouTube. Play unrated or custom games to explore maps, noting key areas (e.g., A Short, B Main). Communicate with teammates to learn common terms, and use pings to mark locations during matches.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:What are the best weapons in Valorant?A:The Vandal, Phantom, and Operator are top-tier for full-buy rounds. The Vandal offers consistent damage with a slower fire rate, the Phantom excels in close-to-mid range with faster firing, and the Operator is ideal for sniping. For eco rounds, the Ghost (pistol) or Spectre (SMG) are cost-effective. The Phantom has the best first-shot accuracy.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How do I manage weapon purchases?A:Buy pistols (e.g., Ghost) in the first two rounds, saving for rifles like the Vandal or Phantom in later rounds. Coordinate with your team to ensure balanced buys, avoiding situations where some have rifles and others don’t. Use the buy menu to check future credits and plan eco or half-buy rounds.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How important is spray control in Valorant? A:Valorant lacks a predictable recoil system, so avoid spraying. Focus on burst firing or tapping for accuracy, especially with rifles. Practice first-shot accuracy in the Range, as landing the initial bullet is critical in this precision-based game.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:Why am I missing shots even with good aim?A:Missing shots often stems from moving while shooting, which reduces accuracy. Stop moving (release WASD) before firing. Poor crosshair placement (not at head level) or high ping can also cause misses. Practice in Deathmatch to improve movement and aim synergy.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:Which gun should I use in pistol rounds? A:In pistol rounds (first round or eco rounds), the Ghost is the most popular choice due to its balance of cost, accuracy, and damage. The Classic (free default) is viable for tight budgets, while the Sheriff is great for headshot-focused players with extra credits.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:What is the difference between Unrated and Competitive modes? A:Unrated is casual, with no rank impact, played as best of 25. Competitive mirrors Unrated but includes a ranking system (Iron to Radiant) with a “win by two” overtime rule. Players need level 20 to unlock Competitive, and ranks reflect skill after five placement games.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:What is Spike Rush, and how is it different?A:Spike Rush is a faster mode (best of 7, first to 4 wins) where all attackers carry a Spike, but only one can be planted. Guns are randomized, abilities are fully charged (except ultimates, which charge faster), and power-up orbs add variety, making it more casual than Unrated.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:Why can’t I surrender in some matches? A:Surrendering requires a team vote (4/5 in Unrated, 5/5 in Competitive) and is limited to three chances: once in the first half, once in the second half’s pistol round, and once later in the second half. If the vote fails or you’ve used all chances, you can’t surrender.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How does the ranking system work in Valorant?A:After five placement games (requiring level 20), players are assigned a rank from Iron to Radiant, with three tiers per rank except Radiant (top 500 players per region). Overtime requires a two-match lead, and draws are possible with team votes. Performance impacts rank progression.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How can I improve my rank?A:Focus on communication, objective play (planting/defusing), and consistent aim training. Review VODs to spot mistakes, practice in the Range, and queue with reliable teammates to avoid toxicity. Prioritize teamwork and economy management over solo kills.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:How can I improve my aim in Valorant?A:Practice in the Range for 15–30 minutes daily, focusing on headshot accuracy and burst firing. Use aim trainers like Aimlab for drills. Maintain consistent mouse sensitivity (e.g., 1600 DPI, 0.35 in-game) and practice crosshair placement at head level. Avoid moving while shooting to ensure accuracy.\",\n",
        "    \"Q:Why is my game crashing or freezing?A:Crashes or freezes may stem from outdated drivers, conflicting software, or Vanguard issues. Update your graphics drivers, disable overlays (e.g., Discord, Nvidia), and ensure Vanguard is running correctly. If issues persist, reinstall the game or contact Riot Support for help.\",\n",
